# React + TypeScript + Vite + NextUI

## Getting Started

To set environment variables create a `.env` file in project directory and add the following:

```bash
VITE_API=API_URL_HERE
```

To run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

This project uses basic react structure it can be more enhanced depending on the complexity of the project we can use React Context to avoid prop drilling and making data available for the whole application. Also redux can be use for state management but that depends in the size of the project.

Further more test cases should be defined so each functionality is tested before going to production there are several frameworks we can use eg jest.
